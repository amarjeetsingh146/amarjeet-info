        <h1>The Interpretation of Dreams</h1>
        <div class="date">My thoughts · Feb 2023</div>

        <p>
            <strong>The Interpretation of Dreams</strong> is not an easy book,
            nor is it meant to be.
            Freud does not treat dreams as random images,
            but as meaningful signals —
            fragments of the unconscious speaking in symbols.
        </p>

        <p>
            What fascinated me is the idea that dreams are not meaningless.
            They are distorted messages,
            shaped by fear, desire, memory, and repression.
            The mind hides the truth not to deceive us,
            but to protect us.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Dreams are the royal road to the unconscious.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Freud separates dreams into what we remember
            and what they truly mean.
            The remembered story is only the surface.
            Beneath it lies latent content —
            thoughts we avoid during waking life.
        </p>

        <p>
            This made me reflect on how much of our thinking
            happens outside awareness.
            We believe we are rational,
            but our decisions are often driven
            by forces we don’t consciously acknowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            The book also suggests that repression does not erase thoughts —
            it only buries them.
            Dreams become a safe place
            where forbidden ideas can exist
            without consequences.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            What we deny during the day
            returns at night in disguise.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            While some theories feel dated,
            the core insight remains powerful:
            the mind is layered,
            and consciousness is only a thin surface.
            Ignoring the unconscious
            does not make it disappear.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The Interpretation of Dreams</strong> changed how I see sleep.
            It is not rest alone,
            but dialogue —
            between who we think we are
            and who we actually are.
        </p>
