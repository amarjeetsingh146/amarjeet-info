        <h1>Rich Dad Poor Dad</h1>
        <div class="date">My thoughts · Aug 2025</div>

        <p>
            <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong> is not really about money.
            It is about how differently people are taught to think about money.
            The book contrasts security with opportunity,
            obedience with ownership,
            and comfort with growth.
        </p>

        <p>
            What stood out to me most is how early financial beliefs are formed.
            One voice teaches you to seek safety,
            get good grades,
            and avoid risk.
            The other teaches you to learn systems,
            take calculated risks,
            and think long-term.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The poor and the middle class work for money.
            The rich have money work for them.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This idea is often repeated,
            but rarely understood.
            It does not mean effort is unimportant.
            It means effort without ownership keeps you trapped
            in a cycle of earning and spending.
        </p>

        <p>
            The book also challenges the fear of failure.
            Most people don’t fail because they try and lose —
            they fail because they never try at all.
            Fear of making mistakes becomes a prison,
            especially when society rewards obedience over curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I appreciated is that the book shifts focus
            from income to assets,
            from salary to systems.
            It forces you to ask:
            *If I stop working today, does anything still produce value?*
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Financial freedom begins
            the moment you stop trading time for money.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            <strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong> doesn’t give formulas.
            It changes perspective.
            And sometimes, perspective is the most valuable asset of all.
        </p>
