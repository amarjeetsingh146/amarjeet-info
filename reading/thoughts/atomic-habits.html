        <h1>Atomic Habits</h1>
        <div class="date">My thoughts · April 2025</div>

        <p>
            <strong>Atomic Habits</strong> is not about motivation.
            It is about structure.
            James Clear makes one idea very clear —
            success is not the result of intensity,
            but of consistency.
        </p>

        <p>
            What stayed with me most is the idea
            that habits are not goals to reach,
            but systems to live inside.
            Goals give direction,
            but systems determine progress.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            You do not rise to the level of your goals,
            you fall to the level of your systems.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The book explains habits as a loop:
            cue, craving, response, reward.
            This framework made behavior feel less mysterious.
            Change becomes possible
            when the environment is designed correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
            A powerful insight is identity-based habits.
            Instead of asking,
            “What do I want to achieve?”
            the better question becomes,
            “Who do I want to become?”
        </p>

        <p>
            Small actions,
            repeated daily,
            slowly rewrite identity.
            Progress often feels invisible,
            but the compound effect is relentless.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Every action you take
            is a vote for the type of person you want to be.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Atomic Habits taught me patience.
            Growth does not arrive dramatically.
            It happens quietly,
            almost boringly,
            until one day the change is undeniable.
        </p>

        <p>
            The book is ultimately optimistic.
            It suggests that improvement is always possible —
            not by force,
            but by design.
        </p>
