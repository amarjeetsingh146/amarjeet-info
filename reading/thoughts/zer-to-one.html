        <h1>Zero to One</h1>
        <div class="date">My thoughts · Jan 2025</div>

        <p>
            Most books on startups teach you how to compete.
            <strong>Zero to One</strong> teaches you why competition itself is a trap.
        </p>

        <p>
            Peter Thiel’s central idea is simple but uncomfortable:
            progress doesn’t come from doing something better,
            it comes from doing something <em>different</em>.
            Going from one to n is copying.
            Going from zero to one is creation.
        </p>

        <p>
            What stayed with me most is the emphasis on secrets.
            Thiel argues that every great company begins with a truth
            that very few people believe.
            This idea forces you to ask a hard question:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            If everyone already agrees with you,
            how valuable can your idea really be?
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            The book made me rethink the way we glorify competition.
            We’re taught that competition makes us strong,
            but Thiel flips this entirely.
            In reality, competition keeps you reactive.
            It forces you to optimize instead of invent.
        </p>

        <p>
            Monopoly, in his view, isn’t evil.
            It’s the reward for building something so unique
            that no one else can replace it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another powerful insight is about the future.
            Thiel criticizes “indefinite optimism” —
            the belief that things will improve without a clear plan.
            Real progress comes from definite optimism:
            having a concrete vision and deliberately working toward it.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I appreciated most is that the book isn’t motivational
            in a loud way.
            It’s quietly demanding.
            It asks you to think independently,
            question consensus,
            and sit with uncertainty longer than most people are willing to.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The future doesn’t reward those who follow it —
            it rewards those who design it.
        </blockquote>
