        <h1>The Prince</h1>
        <div class="date">My thoughts · Nov 2025</div>

        <p>
            <strong>The Prince</strong> is not a book about morality.
            It is a book about reality.
            Machiavelli does not ask how rulers <em>should</em> behave,
            he explains how they actually do.
        </p>

        <p>
            What makes this book uncomfortable is its honesty.
            It strips power of romance and shows it as calculation,
            perception, and control.
            Reading it feels less like learning politics
            and more like learning human nature.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Men judge more by the eye than by the hand,
            for everyone can see, but few can feel.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            One of the most misunderstood ideas in the book
            is the argument that it is safer for a ruler to be feared
            than loved.
            Machiavelli is not praising cruelty.
            He is pointing out that love is conditional,
            while fear is predictable.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Prince made me realize how much power depends on appearance.
            Stability matters more than goodness.
            Order matters more than intention.
            A ruler is judged by outcomes,
            not by the purity of their motives.
        </p>

        <p>
            What disturbed me most is how relevant the book still is.
            Centuries later, leaders, institutions,
            and even individuals operate by the same principles:
            manage perception,
            control uncertainty,
            and never appear weak.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Power is not maintained by virtue alone,
            but by understanding how people really behave.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            <strong>The Prince</strong> does not teach you how to rule others.
            It teaches you how power works —
            so you are less likely to be ruled by illusions.
        </p>
