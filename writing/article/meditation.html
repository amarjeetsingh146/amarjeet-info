        <h1>Meditation</h1>
        <div class="date">Feb 9, 2026</div>

        <p>
            I used to think meditation was about calming the mind.
            Sitting still.
            Breathing.
            Feeling peaceful.
        </p>

        <p>
            That’s not what happened.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I actually sat down and did nothing,
            my mind didn’t slow down.
            It got louder.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Meditation didn’t give me silence.
            It showed me how noisy I already was.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Thoughts I thought I had dealt with came back.
            Old memories.
            Unfinished conversations.
            Things I was avoiding without realizing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            At first,
            I thought I was doing it wrong.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later,
            I realized this was the point.
        </p>

        <p>
            Meditation isn’t about escaping your thoughts.
            It’s about finally sitting with them
            without running.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that’s uncomfortable.
            More uncomfortable than most people admit.
        </p>

        <p>
            But slowly,
            something changes.
            Not the thoughts —
            your relationship with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn’t become calmer overnight.
            I just stopped fighting my mind.
            Not all the time.
            And some days, the fight comes back.
