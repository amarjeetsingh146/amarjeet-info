        <h1>Who Are You Really?</h1>
        <div class="date">Dec 18, 2025</div>

        <p>
            Most people live their entire lives answering a question no one ever asked them.
            Society hands them a role, a name, a routine — and they accept it without resistance.
        </p>

        <p>
            But beneath the labels you carry, beneath your profession, your relationships,
            and your online presence, there exists a quieter truth waiting to be noticed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Who you are when no one is watching is who you really are.
            Your thoughts in silence, your reactions in solitude,
            and the choices you make when approval disappears.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Self-discovery does not begin with answers —
            it begins with the courage to question.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Most people fear this question because it demands honesty.
            It strips away comfort and exposes contradictions.
            Yet, without facing it, growth remains impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
            The moment you stop performing and start observing,
            you begin to meet yourself for the first time.
        </p>
