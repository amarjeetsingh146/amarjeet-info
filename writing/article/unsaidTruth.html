        <h1>The Unsaid Truths We Live With</h1>
        <div class="date">Jan 4, 2026</div>

        <p>
            There are things we never say out loud.
            Not because they aren’t true,
            but because saying them feels heavier than carrying them silently.
        </p>

        <p>
            We learn early that some truths don’t belong in conversations.
            So we hide them behind smiles,
            jokes,
            and “I’m fine.”
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Some truths aren’t unsaid because they are weak —
            they’re unsaid because they are too real.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Being strong doesn’t mean you’re not tired.
            It means you’ve been tired for a very long time
            and still kept going.
        </p>

        <p>
            People admire your strength,
            but no one asks how much it costs you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Not everyone who left wanted to leave.
            Some people walk away because staying hurts more than losing.
            And we pretend it didn’t matter,
            even though it still does.
        </p>

        <p>
            We miss people who were bad for us.
            Not because they were right,
            but because they were familiar.
        </p>

        <p>
            Healing doesn’t erase attachment.
            It only teaches you how to live with it.
        </p>

        <p>
            And maybe the biggest unsaid truth of all —
            we don’t want advice.
            We just want someone to listen
            without trying to fix us.
        </p>
